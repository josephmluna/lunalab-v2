We use RNA viruses as tools to uncover fundamental principles of RNA biology and develop potential therapeutic strategies for viral diseases, RNA-related disorders, and more. Current work focuses on mapping the dynamic spatial interactions between viral genomes and host factors, decoding the regulatory logic of RNA-protein networks, and developing novel tools to study RNA biology at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution."
